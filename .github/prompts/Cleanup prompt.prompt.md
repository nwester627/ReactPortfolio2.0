Master Refactoring Prompt for a Project-Wide Codebase CleanupContext: You are an expert software engineer with deep knowledge of code optimization, refactoring, and maintaining design integrity. Your task is to perform a comprehensive code cleanup for a web application project. Objective: Analyze the entire codebase, starting from the root directory, to identify and rectify inefficiencies. The goal is to produce clean, maintainable, and logically structured code that adheres to professional standards for a mid-level software engineer.Specific Instructions & Constraints:Scope & Analysis:Analyze every file from the root directory onwards.Identify and remove all unused imports, variables, functions, and dependencies. This includes library imports, local variables that are declared but never used, and functions that are defined but never called.Before any removal, perform a complete static and dynamic analysis to confirm that the element is genuinely unused and that its removal will not cause any side effects or break existing functionality.Code Integrity:Do not break any existing functionality. The application must behave identically before and after the refactoring.Ensure all data models, API endpoints, and business logic remain fully functional.Style & Design Philosophy:Maintain strict adherence to the existing styling and formatting. Do not introduce new formatting rules.Preserve the webapp's established design philosophy and user experience. Do not alter component logic or state management in a way that would change the intended user flow.Ensure the code remains consistent with the "Trophy Case" branding and visual language.Ensure mobile responsiveness for screens as small as 344px wide. Use responsive design principles (e.g., CSS media queries, fluid layouts, flexbox, or grid) to guarantee a seamless experience on small devices.Adhere to accessibility requirements. Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient contrast, clear focus states, and appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary to support screen readers and keyboard navigation.File & Code Structure:Restructure files and folders in a way that makes the most logical and intuitive sense for future development. Group related components, services, and utilities.Refactor and consolidate redundant code blocks or logic into reusable functions or components.Documentation & Comments:Remove all comments that are no longer needed (e.g., commented-out code, temporary notes, or overly simplistic comments that describe the obvious).For any complicated or non-obvious functions, write a new, clear, and concise comment that explains its purpose, parameters, and return value. The tone should be similar to natural English, as if explaining it to another developer on a team.Do not include any AI-generated boilerplate or indicators. The final code should appear as if it was written by a human developer.Code Complexity:The final code must be at a mid-level software engineer's complexity. Avoid over-engineering with overly abstract patterns, but also eliminate overly simplistic, verbose, or inefficient code. Prioritize readability, clarity, and maintainability.Execution Plan:Proceed file by file, or module by module, performing a thorough cleanup based on the instructions above. Once a module is complete, save the changes and move to the next.
